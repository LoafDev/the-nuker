Nuke your files.

Original code was created by Dillon Beliveau on github: https://github.com/Dillonb/nmuidi

This is just the modified code so I don't accidentally delete my computer and make my life easier (warning: my program sucks)

Also I made another version with ratatui (for text user interface in terminal, should have added this weeks ago but I forgot) for no reason at all lol
here it goes:
